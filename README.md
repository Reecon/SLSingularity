Allows people to whisper the bot for text to speach.

Uses the Microsoft speech engine built in with Windows 10 as the default and you can select any installed voice.

You can also use the full version of Speech2Go (installed in the default path).
All speech options have to be set in the Speech2Go app, it will not take the settings for volume, voice and rate from the bot into account.
Go to `'Edit -> Settings -> Voice settings for recording'` and set your options there. 

The script logs all read messages in `MessageLog.txt` and provides a HTML message log for new messages.
This also shows the last 5 messages from the log file.
